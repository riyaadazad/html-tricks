In a [previous post](/how-to-create-your-own-site-for-free) I described how one could create their own website for free, and I utilized a program called Jekyll. Of course, there are many options other than Jekyll, such as the popular Wordpress.org. I'm here to show you why Jekyll is the better option when deciding how to manage your site.

This is perhaps more of a CMS or no-CMS debate. A CMS is the abbreviated term for a "content management system", which is a clickable, or dynamic, WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") software for managing blogs and websites. It can be heavy sometimes, and is probably overkill for many personal sites.

An amazing alternative to the mess that is CMS is Jekyll, one of the more popular _static_ site generators out there. Unlike a CMS, which is dynamic and has a graphical user interface (WYSIWYG) for managing a website, static site generators are, well, static. This means that everything is done in basic text files with a "language" called Markdown. Markdown is not a hard language to learn (it is _definitely_ not as hard to learn as a traditional "programming" language, such as JavaScript), and is basically like writing a document in a text editor like Microsoft's Notepad, but instead of clicking on a button to bold or italicize a word, you would wrap 2 asterisks (\*) or underlines (\_) around it to bold or italicize the word, respectively. In Markdown, the word "Jekyll" with double asterisks wrapped around it (to bold the text), like \*\*jekyll\*\*, would appear as **Jekyll**. However, don't fret if you do not want to do this, because there are workarounds (see "Prose is Better Than Poetry").
