## Hello Hello
In the next ten minutes, I'll teach you everything that you need to know to get started building your very own website. Start your timer. On your mark, get set, go!

## 1. Hello HTML
So what is HTML anyway, and why is it so important? HTML, which stands for "HyperText Markup Lanuage", is a fundamental part of every website. If you see words on any website, chances are that those words were written in an HTML file (90% of the text that you see on the web is most likely from HTML). 

## 2. Hello CSS

## 3. Hello Git

## 4. Hello GitHub Pages (and Jekyll)

## 5. Hello Prose

## 6. Hello World

## Goodbye
