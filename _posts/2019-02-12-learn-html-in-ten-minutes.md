## Hello Hello
In the next ten minutes, I'll teach you everything that you need to know to get started building your very own website. Start your timer. On your mark, get set, go!

## 1. Hello HTML
So what is HTML anyway, and why is it so important? HTML, which stands for "HyperText Markup Lanuage", is a fundamental part of every website. If you see words on any website, chances are that those words were written in an HTML file. To write your first line of code (which many call a "Hello World" application, for obvious reasons), fire up any text editor (Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit - as long as it is not something like Microsoft Word, which is a _rich_ text editor, not a regular text editor) and type in the following:

\<!DOCTYPE html>

\<html>
  
\<body>
  
\<p>Hello World\</p>
  
\<body>
  
\</html>

Now go ahead and save the file with a file extension of ".html" or ".htm" (either is fine). Now open the file in your browser (double-clicking usually works), and voila! You should see the text "Hello World" on your screen (if you didn't, make sure that you did not omit an angle bracket "<"). 

Okay, so the first line (\<!DOCTYPE html>) is telling the browser that it's looking at an HTML file. Notice how the next lines of code seem to be doubled? That's because each of those words in angle brackets are called "tags", which tells the browser how to display the text. The opening tag "\<html>", for example, always has a closing tag (\</html>), which is denoted by a forward slash, while a line break tag does not have a closing tag, and is merely "\<br>". The next tag, "\<body>", tells the browser that anything in between the opening body tag ("\<body>") and closing body tag ("\</body>") should be displayed, and the p (paragraph) tag of course is displaying the text "Hello World". Pat yourself on the back, you've just done something amazing, and the only way to go from here is up (well, actually, it's down, because you'll need to scroll down to view the rest of this article)!

## 2. Hello CSS
Now go back to your HTML file, and at the top, between the opening "html" and "body" tags, add an opening and closing "head" tag. Your file should now look like this:

\<!DOCTYPE html>

\<html>

\<head>

\</head>
  
\<body>
  
\<p>Hello World\</p>
  
\<body>
  
\</html>

The "head" tag is mainly used for what is known as "metadata", and contains links and such to external CSS files (beyond the scope of this article), but most notably the "title" of the page. Bear in mind that this is actually the title for the browser tab, so it will not show up on the web "page" itself, per se.
