Let's say that you are a student who is looking to enter the workforce. You plan to enroll in a college or university and want to major in journalism (or basically any other major), but you are also open to writing articles for online news and blog sites.

If this person's story is remotely like yours, you could use a website to showcase yourself to future schools and employers. But you can't have your site looking like Wikipedia (unless you intentionally were aiming for that sort of theme). If you agree with all of the above, then you are in the right place.

HTML-Tricks was made for people like you.
